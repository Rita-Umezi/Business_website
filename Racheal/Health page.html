          <div id="salad">
             <img alt="Chicken salad" src="chicken salad.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 160px;">
             <p>
                Chicken salad provides high-quality protein for muscle and bone health, promotes feelings of fullness for appetite and weight management, and can be nutrient-rich with added vegetables and healthy fats like nuts. Customizing recipes with lean proteins and fresh produce makes it a versatile and convenient meal that supports various dietary needs, though calorie content varies significantly based on ingredients like mayonnaise and serving size. 
Health Benefits
High in Protein
: Chicken is a source of lean protein, which is vital for building and maintaining muscle, bones, and cartilage. 
Aids Weight Management
: The protein and fiber in chicken salad contribute to satiety, helping you feel full for longer and reducing cravings and overall calorie intake. 
Supports Metabolism
: The protein in chicken salad increases the thermic effect of food, meaning your body burns more calories to digest it, which can boost your metabolism. 
Nutrient-Dense
: When prepared with fresh ingredients like celery, nuts, and leafy greens, chicken salad provides essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support overall health. 
Customization & Versatility
Diet-Friendly
: You can adapt chicken salad to fit different dietary needs, such as making it ketogenic-friendly by focusing on low-carb vegetables and healthy fats or using dairy-free yogurt for a dairy-free option. 
Convenient
: Chicken salad can be made in advance and stored, making it a quick and easy meal or snack option. 
Health-Focused Ingredients
: You can boost the benefits by adding ingredients like walnuts or sunflower seeds (for selenium and magnesium), chia seeds, or diverse vegetables like spinach and kale. 
Considerations
Ingredient Choices Matter
: The healthfulness of chicken salad depends on the ingredients. Using high-fat mayonnaise, croissants, or excessive amounts of certain ingredients can significantly increase calories and fat content. 
Portion Control
: Even healthy foods should be consumed in appropriate portions to avoid overeating, which can hinder weight loss efforts. 
Variety
: To ensure a wide range of nutrients, it's best to vary your chicken salad ingredients and to not eat the same salad every day.
